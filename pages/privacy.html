  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Chisel uses cookies to keep you logged in, and uses Google Analytics for analytics. We also DO NOT ENCRYPT what you write. That means if an attacker were to gain access to the database, they would be able to see what you have written. If you'd like to help fix this, please submit a PR! In the meantime we highly encourage you to set up your own instance of Chisel. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>

<h3 class="mt-lg text-lg font-semibold">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change the Privacy Policy from time to time, and in our sole discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to Chisel's Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
